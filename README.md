## Map Group Cooldown is NOW OFFICIAL
Tired from players nominate three Final Fantasy in row? But now you can put them in the same group and give them a cooldown! 

## Feture
### New
- Admin or VIP Map only (Check branch "master")
- Nominate Map only (Not appear on the vote without nominations)
- Map group cooldown (Official) 

### Existed
- Map group (This to prevent nominate a map from the same group)
- Cooldown based on cooldown.cfg (no reset cooldown)
- Limit Time for Nominate and play the map

### If you want to use Admin or VIP map only feature, Check out the "master" branch!
